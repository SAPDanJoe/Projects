'Introducing Variables
'Variables hold values in memory in a named location
'so we can refer to the value by name later.

'The creation of a variable is called  a declaration
'We declare variables using the Dim statement

Dim x	'This declares a variable named x
x = 10	'This assigns x the value of 10

'to see that value:
msgbox x 'msgbox displays a dialog box

'a variable is called a variable because its value can change
'a constat's value cannot change
'a variable can be a scalar (single value) or an array (multiple values)
